## Development

Below are some instructions to start working with the project.

1. We use `parcel` to bundle all assets to the `dist` folder, so install it using `npm i -g parcel`.
2. Install all project dependencies using `npm i`.
3. Test if your setup works using `npm start`.

If you, for some obscure reason, want to test a production build, run `npm run build`.
No guarantees if this is functional for you or not. It's meant for Vercel.
